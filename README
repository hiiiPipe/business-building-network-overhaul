## üìù Project Description
Implementation of a segmented network with VLANs, Wi-Fi network and VoIP telephony in a hospital environment.

## üõ†Ô∏è Used Technologies
- **Equipment**: Ubiquiti EFG, Ubiquiti UniFi Switch, Ubiquiti U6 Access Point, Grandstream VoIP gateway, Cisco POE Switch.
- **Software**: UniFi Controller, VLAN 802.1Q.
- **Protocols**: DHCP, Static IP, VoIP (SIP).

## üìä Network Topology

*(Made in [draw.io](https://draw.io) ‚Äì [source file](/diagrams/network-topology.drawio))*

## üöÄ Key Features
1. **VLAN Segmentation**:
 - Default: `192.168.x.x/24`
 - Administration: `192.168.x.x/24`
 - Stuff: `192.168.x.x/24`
 - Servers: `192.168.x.x1/24`
 - Security: `192.168.x.x/24`
 - VoIP Gateway: `Third Party Gateway`
 - Guest: `192.168.x.x/24`
2. **Wi-Fi Network**:
 - SSID: ``Office-Users'' (VLAN 10), ``Office-Guests'' (VLAN 25).
 - Access Point: Ubiquiti U6.
3. **VoIP Telephony**:
 - Isolated VLAN for Grandstream gateway.
 - Static IP addresses for VoIP devices, printers, servers, PCs.
4. **Patch Panel and Sockets**:
 - Organized by offices with labels for easier management.

## üí° Key Learnings
- How to use VLAN tagging for traffic isolation.
- Setup and optimization of the Wi-Fi network in an enterprise environment.
- Integration of the VoIP system with the existing network infrastructure.

## üöÄ Future Improvements
- Implementation of RADIUS authentication for Wi-Fi users.
- Adding network monitoring (eg Zabbix + Grafana).

üö® Problems I encountered during the project.

‚ö†Ô∏è ## Problem 1: Mismatch of LAN Wiring Standard
### What was the problem?
The network sockets in the building were connected according to the **T568A** standard, while the patch panel used the **T568B** standard.

### Why was that a problem?
- **Incomplete Gigabit Ethernet**: Mismatched wiring caused the speed to drop from 1 Gbps to 100 Mbps.
- **Physical mismatch**: Signal pairs were not mapped correctly, leading to performance loss.

### How did I solve the problem?
- **Reconfigured the sockets**: I changed the wiring standard from T568A to T568B on all sockets.
- **Tested the speed**: I used `iperf` and UniFi Controller to check the speed after the intervention.

‚ö†Ô∏è ## Problem 2: Too long UTP Cable and Damage
### What was the problem?
Two buildings connected by a **160 meter** UTP cable (over a main road) had:
- **Extremely low speed** (below 10 Mbps).
- **Damaged cables** from asphalting (broken pairs, corrosion).
- **Incorrect cable use**: UTP cable converted to 4 RJ11 telephone connectors.

### Why was this a problem?
- **Ethernet limitation**: The maximum recommended length of a UTP cable is **100 meters**.
- **EMI interference**: The cables under the road were exposed to electromagnetic interference.

### How did I solve the problem?
- **Replaced UTP with fiber**: Run **multimode fiber** (MMF) between the buildings.
- **Used media converters**: Ubiquiti fiber converters to convert electrical to optical signals.


‚ö†Ô∏è ## Problem 3: Poor VoIP Integration Between Buildings
### What was the problem?
The VoIP gateway in Building 2 was unable to communicate with the PBX in Building 1.

### Why was that a problem?
- **Lack of VLAN segregation**: VoIP traffic mixed with general network traffic.
- **Non-existent routing rules**: Rules for VoIP protocols (eg SIP/RTP) were missing.

### How did I solve the problem?
- **Implemented VLAN for VoIP**: Isolated VoIP traffic on VLAN 2.
- **Configured UniFi switch**: Disabled VLAN VoIP Gateway communication with other VLANs.


‚ö†Ô∏è ## Problem 4: Subnet conflict with VoIP Modem
### What was the problem?
The VoIP modem used the same subnet (`192.168.x.x/24`) as some business computers, which caused:
- **Duplicate IP addresses**.
- **Unavailability of network resources**.

### Why was that a problem?
- **Lack of port isolation**: VoIP devices and computers shared the same broadcast domain.
- **Default settings of UniFi**: "Inter-VLAN routing" enabled unauthorized communication.

### How did I solve the problem?
1. **Isolated the ports**: Used "Port Isolation" on UniFi switch for VoIP gateway.
2. **Firewall rules**: Blocked communication between VoIP VLAN and business VLANs.


‚ö†Ô∏è ## Problem 5: Static DNS Problems!
###What was the problem?
Computers with manually set DNS addresses (eg 8.8.8.8) did not have access to internal resources.

### Why was that a problem?
Unavailability of local services: DNS servers could not resolve internal domains.

Internet Loss: Users thought the Internet "went down."

### How did I solve the problem?
Changing DNS addresses: Set up local DNS servers (eg 192.168.x.x) on all static devices.

User Education: Showed instructions for DHCP configuration instead of manual settings.
